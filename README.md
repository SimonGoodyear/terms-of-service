## Terms of Service project
================

An open source terms of service template to save young businesses the time and money normally needed to get hold of these documents.


### Why should I be interested in this project?

Finding a solid Terms of Service can be a time and money consuming process. These are two commodities that are in short supply when you're a startup. The aim of this project is to build up a repository of legal documentation that you can make use of in your terms and services. 

The documents should be general enough for anyone to make use of either individually or to pick and choose from to form a custom set.

### What needs to be done?

The documents as they stand are very simple copies of the documents we make use of with our applications. I feel as though they should be reviewed and make more generic as a first step. I think that there are probably also documents that other start ups would need but are currently included in this set - I would be keen for people to contribute things that they have found useful in an attempt to fill these gaps.
