As a subscriber, you have the ability to cancel your subscription at any time. Your cancellation will take effect at the end of your current billing period. You will not receive a refund for billing that has already occurred, except in the specific instances described below.

To ensure that your credit card will not be charged for your next billing period, you MUST cancel your subscription no later than the day before your next scheduled billing period begins. Until the end of the current paid billing period, you will still have access to your subscription. On the first day after the current paid billing period expires the subscription will expire, and no further subscription charges will appear on the credit card.

Please note that if you make other purchases from YOUR COMPANY, you will be obligated to pay for them whether or not you cancel your subscription.

You may request a refund and immediate termination of your subscription in the case of fraudulent or unauthorized usage of your credit card. If this is the case, notify us immediately using the support feedback form.
